['\n<p>\n\tPhilosophy:</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Class is &nbsp;raced and maintained by the Association Members preserving the unique heritage of the Howth 17s.

This philosophy is taken account of and explained when the boats are sold.</p>\n<p>\n\tDetailed Philosophy:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li style="margin-left: 36pt; ">\n\t\tOne-design class (nearly equal in inherent speed, with sailing ability and boat preparation the key factors in racing success).</li>\n\t<li style="margin-left: 36pt; ">\n\t\tA wooden boat, built in accordance with the original plans of W.H Boyd in 1897 (frames &amp; timbers, carvel planking, timber deck and deck beams, etc., and with widely differing deck treatments accepted &ndash; laid, plywood, painted, covered, etc.) and fitted with solid wooden spars.</li>\n\t<li style="margin-left: 36pt; ">\n\t\tGaff-rigged in accordance with the original drawings.</li>\n\t<li style="margin-left: 36pt; ">\n\t\tNo winches or ratchet blocks.</li>\n\t<li style="margin-left: 36pt; ">\n\t\tInexpensive to run maintain and repair (capable of being owned and raced competitively by people of modest means).</li>\n\t<li style="margin-left: 36pt; ">\n\t\tThe existing boats are built to the plans by various builders, modified, strengthened and repaired over the years, all with slightly different layouts and fittings, all accepted as being valid 17-footers.</li>\n\t<li style="margin-left: 36pt; ">\n\t\tNot historically accurate as to materials and methods used at the time of original build, but using normal and inexpensive materials and methods current to the time of repair or refit. The original Seventeens were built with materials that were modern at the time (for instance, muntz metal) and were built to standards that were up-to-date at the time. This philosophy should be continued with current building and repairs without altering the &lsquo;look&rsquo; of the boats.&nbsp;Examples are:&nbsp;Dacron sails, horizontally cut mainsails, sail windows, stainless steel and plastic fittings, man-made fibre ropes, modern glues and epoxies, laminated frames,&nbsp;plywood.</li>\n\t<li style="margin-left: 36pt; ">\n\t\tAdjusters needed to control the shape of modern sailcloth can be widely used and are accepted. These would not have been needed with cotton sails. However, these are kept as simple as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: center; ">\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style="line-height: 14px; ">\n\t&nbsp;</h4>\n']
