Mirja Wenski &nbsp;(ladies) and John McDonald (men) were nearest to the pin on the above 168 metre par 3.&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tTwo HYC boats sailed over to the NYC and consequently the Lambay Lady trophy returned the same way as there was no clear winner. &nbsp;As we all know events do not happen by chance but only by the efforts of the generally unappreciated backroom so our thanks to Vincent Wallace and Alan Dooley who coordinated the event and to all the others who assisted in making this a wonderful day which we can hopefully repeat next year on HYC turf.&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tOur particular thanks to Commodore Martin and the NYC on being such marvellous hosts and providing us with such an enjoyable day.&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<hr />\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSutton GC Outing 5th September - Captain&#39;s Prize</h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<img alt="The Fulmar Cup is presented to Conor Holmes by IEGS Captain, Vice Commodore Paddy Judge" class="caption" src="/system/files/3933/custom/golf.png?1568109951" style="width: 400px; height: 345px;" /></p>\n\t<div>\n\t\tDespite a NW wind gusting up to 25 kts 24 players turned out for the event in the blustery but fine weather. &nbsp;Despite the course being in excellent condition the wind made this tight course challenging with any wayward shot severely punished, particularly on the last two holes with the RHS out of bounds. The nearest to the pin was on the 6th where the upslope pin position and a narrow green to play with meant that very few shots were recordable.&nbsp;</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tLater prizes were presented In HYC after a very good dinner with steak/fish and starters plus desert for &euro;30 which also included a half a bottle of wine per person.&nbsp;</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tThe inaugural Fulmar Cup and Captain&rsquo;s prize went to the formidable Connor Holmes who, despite the wind, carded 36 points. &nbsp;Gunther Eickholt scooped the visitor&rsquo;s prize while, making it a family occasion Geraldine, won the ladies longest drive. &nbsp;On a hole where the crosswind caused many to miss the fairway John McDonald outdrove some of our long hitters and won the longest drive for the men while Joe Cull put his ball nearest the pin on the very difficult par 3.</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t<hr />\n\t<h3>\n\t\tKnightsbrook GC Outing 4th July</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t1st &nbsp;with &nbsp;31 &nbsp;points &nbsp; Berchmans &nbsp;Gannon</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t2nd with &nbsp;30 &nbsp;points &nbsp; Larry &nbsp;Banks</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t3rd &nbsp;with &nbsp;30 &nbsp;points &nbsp; Mirja &nbsp;Wenski</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;of &nbsp;class 1 &nbsp;with &nbsp; 28 points &nbsp;Paddy &nbsp;Judge</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;of &nbsp;class 2 &nbsp;with &nbsp;29 &nbsp;points &nbsp;John &nbsp;Bennett</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;of &nbsp;class 3 &nbsp;with &nbsp;23 &nbsp;points &nbsp;Eamonn &nbsp;Doherty</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;of &nbsp;1st &nbsp;9 &nbsp; &nbsp; Billy &nbsp;Morgan</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;of &nbsp;2nd &nbsp;9 &nbsp; &nbsp;Tom &nbsp;Fitzpatrick</div>\n\t<hr />\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSkerries GC Outing - 13th June</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t1st. &nbsp;With &nbsp;36 &nbsp;points &nbsp;Conor &nbsp;Holmes</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t2nd &nbsp;With &nbsp;33 &nbsp;points &nbsp;John &nbsp; Bennett</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t3rd &nbsp; With &nbsp;31 &nbsp;points &nbsp; Damien &nbsp;Jennings</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;in &nbsp;class 1 &nbsp; with &nbsp;29 &nbsp;points &nbsp;Paddy &nbsp;Judge</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;in &nbsp;class &nbsp;2 &nbsp;with &nbsp;28 &nbsp; points &nbsp;Larry &nbsp;Banks</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;in &nbsp;class &nbsp;3 &nbsp;with &nbsp;30 &nbsp; points &nbsp;Mirja &nbsp;Wenski</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;of &nbsp;First &nbsp;9 &nbsp;with &nbsp;17 points &nbsp;John &nbsp;Massey</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner &nbsp;of &nbsp;Second &nbsp;9 &nbsp;with 17 points &nbsp;Anthony &nbsp;Gore Grimes</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<hr />\n\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-family: AllerRegular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Beaverstown GC Outing - 2nd May</span></p>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t1st &nbsp; &nbsp;Billy &nbsp;Morgan</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t2nd &nbsp; Joe &nbsp;Cull</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t3rd &nbsp; &nbsp;Vincent Wallace</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t1st class 1 &nbsp; Conor Murphy</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t1st class 2 &nbsp; John Bennett</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t1st class 3 &nbsp; Eileen Lappin</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner of front 9 &nbsp; Michael Martin</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\tWinner of back 9 &nbsp; Paddy Judge</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/3825/custom/beaverstown-2019.jpg?1558261985" style="width: 250px; height: 258px;" />&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/system/files/3826/custom/beaverstown-2019.jpg?1558262020" style="width: 250px; height: 248px;" /></div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/3827/custom/beaverstown-2019.jpg?1558262053" style="width: 250px; height: 254px;" />&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/system/files/3828/custom/beaverstown-2019.jpg?1558262079" style="width: 250px; height: 172px;" /></div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/3829/custom/beaverstown-2019.jpg?1558262124" style="width: 250px; height: 261px;" />&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/system/files/3830/custom/beaverstown-2019.jpg?1558262152" style="width: 250px; height: 250px;" /></div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
