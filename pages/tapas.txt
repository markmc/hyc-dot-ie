Only &euro;20 for three generous servings (plus &euro;5 deposit for the dish). In our efforts as a club to be sustainable we are working hard to reduce, reuse and recycle. So we have come up with a plan to re-use our casserole dishes. We will add &euro;5 on to the price of a large two portion dish and if you return it for our next special &#39;take-home&#39; dish we will give you &euro;5 back off the price.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
