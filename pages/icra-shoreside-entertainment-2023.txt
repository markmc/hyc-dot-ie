As the regatta runs concurrently with the <u><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/howthmaritimeandseafoodfestival/" target="_blank">Howth Maritime &amp; Seafood Festival</a></strong></u>, there will also be plenty of food, games, and events in the area surrounding HYC -- entrants can enjoy the sights and sounds of Howth village at peak festival atmosphere, and then retreat to the comforts of the Clubhouse to keep the party going.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Saturday night, 9 September, the J24 class will hold their annual championship dinner. Tickets will be available through <a href="http://office@hyc.ie" target="_blank">office@hyc.ie</a>&nbsp;and at the registration desk.</p>\n<p>\n\tSee below for the weekend at-a-glance:</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href="/system/files/5638/custom/icra-agenda.png?1693922728" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="/system/files/5638/custom/icra-agenda.png?1693922730" style="width: 600px; height: 848px;" /></a></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
