The club also runs a comprehensive after-school training program for our juniors, as well as &frac12; day, full day and training camps throughout the year.&nbsp; These are generally focused towards racing but &#39;fun&#39; is always at the centre of our training.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="line-height: 1.4;">Our training venue and facilities are top class and we often have groups of sailors from class associations and the ISA national squads visiting. When appropriate we endeavour to secure places for our members within these groups.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
