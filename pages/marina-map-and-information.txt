['\n<h3>\n\tEntering Howth Harbour and Marina&nbsp;</h3>\n<div>\n\tHowth Harbour is most easily approached from the deeper water and eastern approaches of Howth Sound.</div>\n<div>\n\tThe marina entrance is clearly marked with green and red markers. It is important to keep between these markers as the harbour dries in many areas on either side at low water.</div>\n<div>\n\tPlease keep to the starboard side of the channel when entering or leaving the Marina, passing other boats port-to-port.</div>\n<div>\n\tOnce inside the Marina basin, keep to the Marina side of the red pillar marks to stay within the fairway.</div>\n<div>\n\tA speed limit of 4 knots is in force in the Harbour and Marina area.</div>\n<div>\n\t<span style="line-height: 1.4;">The marina office (contact VHF CH 37/ CH 80) will advise of your appointed berth &ndash; see layout below and click on image to expand:</span></div>\n<div>\n\t<span style="line-height: 1.4;"><a href="/system/files/220/custom/marina-map.jpg?1385386233" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="/system/files/220/custom/marina-map.jpg?1385386233" style="width: 200px; height: 142px;" /></a></span></div>\n']
