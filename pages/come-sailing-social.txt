['\n<p>\n\tThis Come Sailing social page is all about what we have arranged for you to make sure you get the most out of your sailing summer. Our plans are to have J80 Pay and Sail Racing every Wednesday night and Saturday afternoon which members and friends can book through our office. We will also have our 20&#39;s &amp; 30&#39;s Nights on the last Friday of each month and our over 40&#39;s night on the first Friday of each month.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href="http://hyc.ie/20-s-30-s-night"><img alt="" src="/system/files/4172/custom/20-30-s-j80-racing.jpg?1585660651" style="width: 250px; height: 167px;" /></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="" src="/system/files/4173/custom/over-40-s-racing.jpg?1585660837" style="width: 250px; height: 167px;" /></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile we are in temporary lockdown, you can look forward to joining in our HYC e-Sailing Championship, we will be in touch with you soon regarding full details.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/4168/custom/e-sailing-spring-lockdown-series.jpg?1585652817" style="width: 600px; height: 400px;" /></p>\n']
