['\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 18px;">Welcome to Howth!</span></p>\n<p>\n\tWe are looking forward to greeting some new faces and seeing some friends from previous years. We expect to have over 180 boats competing in this year&#39;s event.</p>\n<p>\n\tA large team of volunteers from HYC and other clubs has been assembled to make sure that you have a great time afloat and ashore. Special thanks to visiting clubs for offering RIBs and resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tCloser to the event, we will continue to update this site with more information to make this event as easy as possible for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe club officers and staff are very excited about the event. If you have any questions or queries, get in touch.</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href="mailto:optimists@hyc.ie?subject=Optimist%20Nationals%20-%20Query&amp;body=Your%20name%3A%0AYour%20email%3A%0AYour%20phone%20number%3A%0AQuery%3A"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>optimists@hyc.ie</strong></span></a></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Mark McLoughlin, Event Chair</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&nbsp;<img alt="" src="/system/files/5805/custom/iodai-logo-2024.jpeg?1703683554" style="width: 192px; height: 300px;" /></strong></p>\n']
