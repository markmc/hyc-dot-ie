['\n<p>\n\tThe steps to chartering one of the Club J80&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t1. Fill out our J80 Questionnaire form. This form can be found online here. Once you have completed the form mail it to sailing@hyc.ie and Matthew or Brian will get in touch with you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t2. The next step is to become an approved skipper. This involves a 3 hour assessment session. In this session you will have to perform a MOB drill and picking up a mooring. The full details of the assessment are available to view here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t3. After the assessment you will have to do a familiarization session with the boats. This is to ensure you know how the engine works, how long a tank of fuel will last etc.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter you have completed those three steps you will be able to charter a J80 for the day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are looking to charter a J80 for racing, you will need to fill in an additional form that details your racing experience.&nbsp;</p>\n']
