By emailing this crew list the berth-holder (licensee) undertakes that the visitors listed have each confirmed that they are:</span></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div style="margin-left: 2cm;">\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well (have no new cough, shortness of breath, fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pains, loss of smell, sore throat, or headaches).</span></div>\n<div style="margin-left: 2cm;">\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have had no close contact or household contact with a suspected or confirmed case of&nbsp; &nbsp; COVID-19 in the past 2 weeks.</span></div>\n<div style="margin-left: 2cm;">\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have not travelled abroad in past 2 weeks.</span></div>\n<div style="margin-left: 2cm;">\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<h3>\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Government Protocol to be Adhered to</span></h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Social Distancing of a minimum 2m on board (excluding Households).</span></div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Maximum group size of 4 unless one household/family</span></div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Non-essential travel limited to within 5Km of home (20Km after 8<sup>th</sup> June).</span></div>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Effective Measures to Keep Yourself and Fellow Marina Users Safe</span></div>\n<div>\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">We are advised expertly that the wearing of masks on the marina is not an effective measure and as a result it is discontinued. The most effective measures are:</span></div>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">The practice of cough etiquette and socially distance from others not in their household.</span></div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Being respectful and aware of others and not creating a bottleneck especially on the marina.</span></div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Being particularly responsible around older persons who are at higher risk.</span></div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Not attending the club if you have any new symptoms that might be Covid-19 e.g. cough, fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, chills, sore throat, muscle aches, loss of smell and headaches. Check with your G.P. whether you need testing.</span></div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Regular washing of hands with soap or alcohol and avoid touching you face, eyes or mouth.</span></div>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Ireland&#39;s Eye Temporarily Out Of Bounds</span></h3>\n<div>\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">We have had confirmation from An Garda Siochana that Ireland&rsquo;s Eye is closed. This is an offshore island and access is not currently permitted under regulations. There was a recent anti-social incident on the Island that involved the Gardai which has heightened their awareness. If anchored off, dinghy sailing or motor boating near Ireland&rsquo;s Eye then please do not go ashore.</span></div>\n<h3>\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;"><font face="AllerRegular, Arial, sans-serif"><b>New Card Swipe Installed to Exit Marina</b></font></span></h3>\n<div>\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Following feedback from members struggling with gear and wheel barrows trying to swipe and exit the marina gate we have installed a card swipe to replace the finger pad at the main marina gate exit. You will require your card now to exit which is also more hygienic and secure.</span></div>\n<div>\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Summary</span></div>\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Each member must enter by scanning their card and no tailgating is allowed.</span></div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Masks are no longer required on the marina pontoons but respect people&rsquo;s space when passing by using the finger intersections.</span></div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">You can bring any non-member guest as long as you comply with the Government restrictions, but <strong><u>you must </u></strong>supply the name, email and mobile phone number of each non-member contact in advance. Failure to do this will unfortunately mean refusal of admittance.</span></div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<span style="font-size:14px;">Irelands Eye is closed and under Garda surveillance &ndash; do not go ashore.</span></div>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;">These changes come into effect at 0900 on Fri 29<sup>th</sup> May and I hope the help you enjoy your limited sailing more and responsibly in this beautiful weather.</span></div>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/4079/custom/commodore-signature.jpg?1580326510" style="width: 285px; height: 121px;" /></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style="font-family: AllerRegular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">Commodore</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
