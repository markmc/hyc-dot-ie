['\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Volunteers</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">There is a lot of work and fun involved in running the &lsquo;On The Water&rsquo;&nbsp;operation at&nbsp;HYC.&nbsp;The Sailing Development Officer, Matthew Cotter, manages it with the assistance of professional coaches and volunteer Club members. &nbsp;New volunteers are always welcome and it is a great way to meet new people and contribute to the enjoyment of your fellow members while all the time adding to your own enjoyment and experience of membership at HYC.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">Let us know your time availability and the area where you would most like to participate.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">Below are just some of the opportunities that are open to you at Howth YC and where your help would be very appreciated.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong style="font-size: 16px;">Committee Boat</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">Come out as a guest and see how the operation runs. Talk to the Race Management Team on board one of the Club&rsquo;s two Committee Vessels and get all the info first hand. You will learn loads about how a race course is set up, how races are started and the finishers are recorded so that results can be worked out.&nbsp;We also need Rib Drivers/Mark-Layers as part of the race management teams.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<a href="mailto:rorrgm@gmail.com"><span style="font-size:16px;">Contact Robert Orr</span></a></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong><span style="font-size:16px;">RIB Drivers &amp; Mark Layers</span></strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">All sailing events need the support of boats to lay racing marks and provide safety cover for competitors.&nbsp; In Howth we use RIBs (rigid inflatable boats) for this service and the boats are crewed from a panel made up of paid staff and volunteer members.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great way to see top class racing from close-up while developing your own boat handling skills.&nbsp; Training is provided and taking a course on Powerboat Handling is probably the best way to start.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<a href="mailto:brian@hyc.ie"><span style="font-size:16px;">Contact Brian McDowell</span></a></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Harbour Wall East Pier Starter&rsquo;s Hut</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">Races in Howth Sound are started and finished from the East Pier Hut, which operates on Tuesday and Saturdays and even a short time commitment (less than I hour) would help get a race started or finished, as you prefer.&nbsp; Come along and see it in operation if you are free.
