['\n<p>\n\tThis is the inaugural year of Wave Regatta - an event that has been built to show the very best of what HYC and <img alt="" src="/system/files/3446/custom/wave-regatta-logo.jpg?1527181922" style="width: 230px; height: 327px; margin: 5px; float: right;" />Howth can provide in terms of yacht racing, hospitality and natural resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe event team have put together the following information for HYC members and their guests:</p>\n<h3>\n\t<span style="color:#ff0000;"><span style="font-family: AllerRegular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">The schedule</span></span></h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tFriday 1st - Racing from 1100 with some evening races for One Designs (with special &#39;Wave Beer&#39; prizes!)</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSaturday 2nd - Racing from 1100 with Lambay Races for all fleets</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSunday 3rd - Racing from 1100 and completion of event</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>\n\t<span style="color:#ff0000;"><font face="AllerRegular, Arial, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 15px;"><b>How will I get there?</b></span></font></span></h3>\n<p>\n\tIt being a Bank Holiday Weekend, there will be significant extra traffic around Howth, so we&#39;ve added some assistance for members wishing to come to the club for racing or just for socialising:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tAdditional Bicycle Racks for cyclists</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tExtra DART carriages thanks to Iarnrod Eireann</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tSpecial daily ferry service from Dun Laoghaire at 0815 (arrive Howth 0915) <a href="https://dublinbaycruises.rezgo.com/details/144006/howth-regatta-sailing">Book here</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\tParking will obviously be limited and much of it reserved for emergencies</p>\n<h3>\n\t<span style="color:#ff0000;">Is the event just for the racing sailors?</span></h3>\n<p>\n\tNo. The event invites all members to attend on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and enjoy the atmosphere. The club would also like members to invites friends and family to join the festival atmosphere, non-stop live music and superb array of food and drink options at the festival zone and in the clubhouse. Because of the necessary security at the club gates, members must carry and present their club ID cards on entering. Guests will be accommodated and admitted with event wristbands which are available from the club office. (Limited to 3 per member)</p>\n<h3>\n\t<span style="color:#ff0000;">What can I expect each evening?</span></h3>\n<p>\n\tFrom 1630 each day there will be an amazing line-up of the very best bands and live music on the festival stage (centred where the club dinghy pen is normally located) and footage of the day&#39;s racing on the giant 10m x 5m screen above the stage and facing the club balcony. The festival area (forecourt) will be covered by 2 huge &#39;stretch tents&#39; lit up with the festival lighting and with special seating and tables for 300 people. Adjacent to the stage, a huge 25m long external bar will be erected to provide a selection of the most popular refreshment for everyone. (Club cards are not required at this bar.)</p>\n<p>\n\tA special &#39;street food&#39; area will offer a selection of superb quality apres-sail fare, provided by our festival catering partners Knights Catering. With the addition of state of the art sound and lighting, the Moet et Chandon champagne bar, the RedBull team will be onsite with a pick-me-up on Saturday morning and cocktail service later, a 3-course dining experience upstairs in the clubhouse dining room and tapas in the lounge - this will be an unforgettable experience and one that we invite every member to attend (with your crew and friends)</p>\n<h3>\n\t<span style="color:#ff0000;">How can I help?</span></h3>\n<p>\n\tOne of the challenges to hosting an event of this scale is the availability of space all around the club. Whilst help has been given by the harbour authorities by allocating deep water berthing in the inner harbour, we still need to make sure that we can welcome more visitors to the marina. So we&#39;d be grateful if non-participating and boat-owning members would like to avail of a special deal in Malahide Marina that weekend, freeing up more space where we can. (And making sure you still make the party!) The hardstanding will also be very busy and we&#39;d really appreciate the temporary removal of any remaining boats and trailers before the festival zone is built next Wednesday.</p>\n<h3>\n\t<span style="color:#ff0000;">So cancel any other plans that you have for the weekend...!</span></h3>\n<p>\n\tAnd join the best sailing event in Ireland in 2018 - racing - hospitality - dining - and one weekend-long party!</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href="/system/files/3447/custom/wave-programme.jpg?1527184170"><img alt="" src="/system/files/3447/custom/wave-programme.jpg?1527184170" style="width: 600px; height: 424px;" /></a></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">More at <a href="http://waveregatta.com">waveregatta.com</a></span></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
