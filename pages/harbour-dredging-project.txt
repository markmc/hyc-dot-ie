['\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">&quot;Some good news at last! The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have informed Howth Yacht Club that they have received approval to proceed with the planning process for the dredging of Howth Harbour. The attached document provides details of the plans and proposals. The dredging of the fairway and the marina is included in these plans. This is very positive news for the Howth Yacht Club. However it should be noted that this is just one stage of an overall process. There are a significant number of milestones that will need to be achieved before the dredging becomes a reality. To that point it is important that HYC members actively support the proposals and positive submissions would be very helpful. Obviously there are short term inconveniences with all such construction projects. However this dredging campaign is required to secure the future viability of the entire harbour, the marina and the overall amenity.&quot;</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="" src="/system/files/4557/custom/tom-mcmahon.jpg?1615892560" style="width: 250px; height: 250px;" /></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px"><em>Tom McMahon, </em></span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px"><em>HYC Committee Member with responsibility for Marina &amp; Harbour&nbsp;</em></span></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">&quot;The siltation of Howth harbour is an ongoing problem due to the orientation of the Harbour entrance and the impact of weather and tide. As an example, few years ago due to strong North Easterly gales, large volumes of sand were washed off Portmarnock beach. Some of this sand was carried on the ebbing tide and was deposited within the Harbour and Marina. In that year alone about 50 mm of sand was deposited in the Marina basin. On average every year between 40 to 50 mm of silt is deposited, mostly emanating from the Malahide estuary, which of course must ultimately be removed, for the commercial and leisure activities of the Harbour, to continue to function.&nbsp; It is now at the stage where this dredging must take place. This work must be carried out in conjunction with the dredging of the Fishery Harbour and the outer Harbour. Dredging only one location on its own will result in it filling back up very quickly as the silt from the adjoining, undredged sites will simply flow into the newly dredged area. To further complicate matters some of the silt is contaminated and the disposal of this material in an approved manner other than dumping at sea will be challenging.&quot;</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/4556/custom/michael-murphy.jpg?1615892285" style="width: 250px; height: 250px;" /></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><span style="font-size: 16px;">Michael Murphy, HYC Member</span></em></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">&quot;Last week&rsquo;s announcement that the planning process for dredging our Harbour is a first step that we have all been waiting for. &nbsp;Although delayed, it is nonetheless welcome as the silt in our moorings and marina slowly but surely builds up.&nbsp; There will be many other steps in this process, each of which will have to be dealt with, but I am happy to say that relationships between ourselves and our landlords are good as we take this first step.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">There are a number of other issues that will probably arise and rather than speculate we intend to hold a webinar next week so that we can have an open discussion about matters arising. In the meantime, I hope you all keep safe and I look forward to talking to you next week.&quot;</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<em><span style="font-size:16px;">Paddy Judge, HYC Commodore</span></em></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href="/system/files/4553/original/marina-dredging-proposal.pdf?1615842824"><img alt="" src="/system/files/4550/custom/harbour-dredging-button.jpg?1615840832" style="width: 550px; height: 51px;" /></a></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<a href="https://hyc.ie/quarterly-briefing"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt="" src="/system/files/4558/custom/quarterly-briefing.jpg?1615894225" style="width: 500px; height: 281px;" /></span></a></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">This month, the new Commodore&#39;s Quarterly Briefing Webinar will update all our members on the latest information on sailing and the Marina.&nbsp;<a href="https://hyc.ie/quarterly-briefing">For full details and to register click here.</a>&nbsp;In the meantime, please do not hesitate to get in touch through</span><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:commodore@hyc.ie?subject=Harbour%20Dredging" style="font-size: 16px;" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">email</span></a><span style="font-size: 16px; color: rgb(0, 128, 128);">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 16px;">if you have any particular questions or issues you would like to discuss.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
