The final choice was for a pergola&nbsp;with&nbsp;glass sliding walls, which will add a new dimension to our balcony area for outdoor dining and all-weather access.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe&nbsp;glass sliding door system for the Pergola consists of sliding panels on all sides, which can be pulled back to open up on days of good weather, and when closed, will allow us to continue to enjoy our deck area on milder days, or until late in the evening.&nbsp; The sliding walls will protect against the wind, cold, rain and even insects while not losing the great view of the marina and harbour. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe roof comprises solid motorised blades that rotate through 150 degrees, allowing the blades to be adjusted to defend against wind and rain while maximising the sunshine.&nbsp; For the evening, there are infrared heaters built into the structure, as well as led lighting.&nbsp; It comes fitted with a rain sensor that automatically closes the roof blades with the onset of rain, so there will be no need to scramble indoors.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs part of the Pergola exploratory survey, it was discovered that the decking on the balcony is in poor condition. As such, it will need to be replaced before the installation of the Pergola.&nbsp; We expect these works to be completed in 8 weeks, with the Pergola being installed shortly after this.</p>\n<p>\n\tBelow are some of the drawings our supplier has provided to show how it will look in situ.&nbsp; The new installation has a projected lifespan of 25 years, so we are looking forward to enjoying this new all-weather space with you for a considerable time to come.</p>\n<br />\n<p>\n\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/4575/custom/pergola-drawings.jpg?1617878724" style="width: 550px; height: 365px;" /></p>\n<h1>\n\t&nbsp;</h1>\n']
