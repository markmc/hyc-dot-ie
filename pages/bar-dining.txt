['\n<h3>\n\tBar</h3>\n<p>\n\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/55/custom/bar-1.jpg?1347610330" style="width: 600px; height: 232px;" /></p>\n<p>\n\tThe club&#39;s bar flows into three separate areas for members and guests to enjoy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe main bar is located on the first floor and is spacious, bright and modern with extensive views over the marina, harbour area and the islands of Lambay and Ireland&#39;s Eye. The lounge bar links directly with the dining room and provides a comfortable seating area around the large modern fireplace and is often used as a bright and warm reception area prior to dining or events. The &#39;snug&#39; is where the long winter nights are sipped away in cosy comfort around the small turf fire. The bar, lounge and dining room all share an extensive sweeping balcony that opens out into a large sunny terrace.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/326/custom/balcony.jpg?1389558018" style="width: 600px; height: 265px;" /></p>\n<p>\n\tThe bar is well stocked with beers, wines and spirits as well as the large range of soft drinks, coffees, teas, draught beers, sandwiches and snacks that every sailor would expect of one the largest yacht clubs in this part of the world.</p>\n<h3>\n\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/2851/custom/dining-room.jpg?1472934376" style="width: 600px; height: 306px;" /></h3>\n<h3>\n\tDining Room&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>\n\tThe magnificent dining room can be tastefully partitioned to cater for events and dining from a small dinner party and private dining rooms to a gala dinner for almost 200 people.
