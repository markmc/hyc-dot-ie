We will be engaging together and liaising with Fireball fleets worldwide to see if suitable dates can be found in 2021 or further into the future to welcome Fireballers to Ireland for a World Championships.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tFor those who have already registered and paid HYC will refund the entry fee on the next working day.</div>\n<div>\n\tWe would like to express our thanks to the many volunteers who have been working away in the background and most especially to those who have offered sponsorship and financial support, in particular Gull International, Fingal County Council, the Irish Sports Council, Irish Sailing and Irish Ferries.</div>\n<div>\n\tWe make this announcement with great regret but in the hope and expectation that we will hoist sails and raise a glass together in healthier and happier times in the not too distant future.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tIssued on behalf of the Irish Fireball Association, Howth Yacht Club and Fireball International</div>\n']
