Members sail, cruise, and anchor in company, exchange safety, technical and cruising information, and generally enjoy themselves afloat and ashore.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the main sailing season (May to September), the Group organises day cruises (&quot;armadas&quot;) to various anchorages and harbours around the coast, and sets off on longer cruises too; always with an eye to inclusion, safety, sociability and a good bite to eat.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the off-season, there are shorter sails to somewhere for dinner and an overnight stay, and also informative talks, interesting events, and important fundraisers (like the sunrise sail for the Darkness into Light campaign), organised for its members and for the good of all the Club. Theory and practical training is organised from time to time. The Cruising Group meets on the first Monday of each month and all are welcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you want to join the Cruising Group, just send an email to cruising@hyc.ie. You must be a HYC member, but you don&#39;t need to own a boat or even have done much or any sailing - we&#39;ll look after that!</p>\n<p>\n\tCheck out the links on the left to see what we do and to check on our next event.</p>\n']
