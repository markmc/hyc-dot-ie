The male and female changing rooms have seen a transformation with a fresh lick of paint ready for when our members and visitors return to sailing.&nbsp; The team have also taken on the task of varnishing all of the woodwork in the bar and seating areas, painting all the woodwork and skirtings around the bar, dining and Asgard rooms as well as deep cleaning all the carpets and soft furnishings.&nbsp; The bathrooms on the main floor and the main hallway are next on the list.&nbsp; We are sure you will agree that they are doing a great job and we look forward to welcoming everyone back to the Clubhouse soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tSee <a href="https://hyc.ie/gallery/albums/293-multi-talented-make-over-team">Full Gallery here </a>of a few shots that Paddy managed to grab on his rounds...</p>\n']
