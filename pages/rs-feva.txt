The dinghy can be rigged with a gennaker and is an exciting and safe introduction to gennaker-sailing. The hull material is made of plastic, as a result it is a lot less fragile and does not require as much maintenance as fibreglass. Encapsulated buoyancy in the foam layer makes the RS Feva unsinkable. The mast is divided into two parts and can be stored along with boom in the length of the boat for easy transport.</p>\n<p>\n\tA big cockpit and high boom make the Feva comfortable for youngsters and adults. The Feva is the perfect size and has rig options that allow easy handling by one sailor, family crews or friends. Her high-volume hull makes light work of heavy sailors. Not only confidence inspiring and very easy to sail, the Feva is also the fastest of her type. A strict one design means no hidden costs, evenly matched performance and highly tactical racing.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere in Howth we have a growing fleet of Feva&#39;s and have double handed training sessions held on Sunday&#39;s. In addition there is a PY start for dinghy racing on Thursdays throughout the summer season.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you would like to know more about the RS Feva and what is available for Feva&#39;s in Howth please contact the class captain Emmet Sheridan.
