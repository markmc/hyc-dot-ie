['\n<div>\n\tAs members are aware the majority of payments into the HYC accounts are by credit card or bank transfer. &nbsp;Some members like to pay their invoices directly and others prefer to use a direct debit mandate. &nbsp;The vast majority of all these transfers are processed faultlessly and we would like to thank members for your continued support in this regard. &nbsp;However, on occasion the direct debit bounces. &nbsp;In addition to the &euro;3.30 fee imposed by the bank a substantial amount of administration time has to be spent on reprocessing that individual mandate.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tOur procedure to date has been not to pass on these costs to the individual member but then other members have had to carry these costs. This is not sustainable and to cover the costs of each rejected transaction a &euro;10 charge will be implemented with immediate effect. &nbsp;Note that if the debit mandate is refused three times it will not be resubmitted and the member is required to make alternative arrangements.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThis issue applies to a very small, but often recurring, number of members and I am sure that everyone recognises the need to reduce all costs within our control.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tPaddy Judge</div>\n<div>\n\tRear Commodore</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n']
