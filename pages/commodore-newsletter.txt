['\n<p>\n\tIts hard to believe that the Summer season 2024 is now less than a month away. The first Club race is scheduled for <strong>Tuesday, April 23rd</strong> when the One Design keelboats resume activity, followed by <strong>Wednesday night racing</strong> for the Handicap keelboat Classes the following evening. This year also promises a revival in <strong>Thursday Dinghy Racing</strong> with the newly arrived Melges 15, a fleet of a dozen boats itching to get out and match themselves against the more established dinghies. Apart from the Melges, the Club dinghy fleet has seen a number of new members joining this year to race. Additional GP14s, perhaps an IDRA or two and an Enterprise are expected to take to the Sound to benchmark themselves against the established ILCAs, Aeros and Fevas as well as the speedier Melges so please have a look around to see whether you have a boat, or one you can sign up to crew in, to add to the competition. Dinghy racing commences on Thursday 25th April.</p>\n<p>\n\tActivity around the deck area has noticeably increased as keelboat crews get themselves organised to meet the <strong>April 13th deadline</strong> for those whose boats have been stored ashore over the winter to get them back in the water. In advance of the first races, a programme of talks has been arranged to help blow away the cobwebs. The opening one was last Tuesday (Mar 26th) when Dermot Skehan and Fergal Kinsella covered how to start racing, particularly for would-be competitors in the White Sails Class. On Apr 3rd (Wed), <strong>Shane Hughes of North Sails </strong>will cover how to make gains around the racecourse and on Apr 9th (Tues) <strong>Emmet Dalton </strong>will talk about the practicalities of utilising the Racing Rules of Sailing to help you win races.</p>\n<p>\n\tApart from the above racing focussed events, there are plenty of others arranged for the upcoming month and <a href="https://hyc.ie/social_events/315">details can be found on the Club&rsquo;s website </a>&ndash; see the left side of the homepage. Easter is also on our doorstep and Easter Sunday will feature a Family Lunch and Easter Egg Hunt starting at 12.30pm, advance booking required.</p>\n<p>\n\tWinter sailing in the Club was brought to a close on the weekend of March 2/3 when both the <a href="https://hyc.ie/news/1132-frostbite-series-prize-giving-event-shines-in-the-face-of-bad-weather-affecting-round-the-island-race">Dinghy Frostbiters</a> and the keelboats racing in the <a href="https://hyc.ie/news/1133-howth-yacht-club-s-popular-brass-monkeys-spring-series-kindly-sponsored-by-the-bright-motor-group-concluded-on-saturday-2nd-march">Bright Motor Group Brass Monkeys</a> enjoyed the last races of their respective series. In the Dinghy event, the 45-boat fleet included ILCAs, divided by rig size into 4, 6 and 7 fleets, and a PY Handicap fleet. The respective winners were Stan O&rsquo;Rourke, Tom Fox, Conor Murphy and Daragh Sheridan while Charlie Robertson won the &lsquo;Slow Fleet&rsquo; division of the PY Class. The 10-boat Brass Monkeys fleet enjoyed exceptionally close racing with Mary Ellen of Howth YC shading first place on countback after tying with Billy Whizz from Malahide YC. The Round the Island dinghy extravaganza planned for Mar 9th fell foul of the weather for a second year in succession when the strong easterly wind and big sea prevented any racing. That did not dent the enthusiasm of the attendance at the Frostbite prizegiving lunch, despite the result of the England Ireland rugby international not going as hoped for by most of those who stayed on to watch.</p>\n<p>\n\tPlanning for the <strong><a href="https://www.waveregatta.com">WAVE Regatta</a></strong> is gathering pace and the event website is now open &ndash; We are excited today to announce that Porsche Centre Dublin are the headline sponsor and have signed up to support what promises to be a top-notch event, both ashore and afloat.&nbsp;Their commitment to excellence and innovation aligns perfectly with our Club&rsquo;s values and this partnership ensures that Wave 2024 will maintain the regatta&rsquo;s established reputation as a top-class national event.</p>\n<p>\n\tIrish Sailing brought their <strong>Annual Awards Ceremony</strong> to the Club on March 22nd and turned our entire dining area into a state-of-the-art theatre for the evening. There was a huge HYC representation on the list of nominees in the various award categories, including the Club itself being nominated as the Irish Sailing Club of the Year. Whilst the Club award went to Galway Bay SC, there was huge applause when our own <strong>Eve McMahon</strong> was announced as the winner of the evening&rsquo;s premier award, <strong><a href="https://hyc.ie/news/1138-eve-mcmahon-crowned-irish-sailing-s-sailor-of-the-year-at-friday-s-ceremony-in-hyc">Sailor of the Year</a></strong>. She adds this to her previous victories in the Young Sailor of the Year category and to her 2023 successes in becoming World Under 21 ILCA Champion as well as securing an invite to represent Ireland at the upcoming Olympics. She continues on the upward trajectory in her already stellar career and we wish her the very best with her preparations leading to Marseilles, the Olympic sailing venue, next July.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur<strong> K25 Squad </strong>has been a success story of Howth YC in recent years and this year the Team will be the beneficiary of the<strong> <a href="https://hyc.ie/news/1136-summer-ahoy-howth-yacht-club-s-2024-season-launch-party">Season Opening Party</a></strong> in the Club on <strong>Saturday, April 6th</strong>. Tickets are just &euro;25 so please make sure to support this great initiative that keeps our young sailors competing and developing their skills in order to assure the future success of Howth YC. The K25s have exciting plans for the coming season and will be competing in Club racing and at J24 Open events in Kilcullen, the Club&rsquo;s J24, as well as having a team challenging for the Commodore&rsquo;s Cup event, hosted in July by the Royal Yacht Squadron and sailed in J70 keelboats provided by the organisers.</p>\n<p>\n\tA <strong>Members&rsquo; Briefing meeting</strong> was held on March 14th and was very well attended - thanks to everyone who came along. The topics covered included the planned replacement of Star Point, our larger Committee Vessel, the transition to cashless bar and dining in the Club with credit or membership cards instead used for payment, the necessity for guests to be signed into the bar as per the terms of our bar licence, the changes planned to some of the Summer racing marks for this season and how members can volunteer to get involved in the various aspects of Howth YC.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the constructive Q and A session after the formal presentations, the length of the <strong>waiting list for marina berths</strong> was highlighted by a number of members as a significant concern. By con-incidence, several changes are being introduced from April 1st that will affect how members gain access to the waiting list, the cost of applying for a berth and the management of the waiting list. These are being adopted to hopefully make the waiting list a truer reflection of what the demand for berths is and to shorten the time between a member applying for a berth and being assigned one. Changes are also being made to the management of the marina and some berth holders have recently received letters asking them to attend to issues affecting their boats. The marina is a valuable Club asset and it is in the interests of all members that boats assigned berths are used regularly rather than being left tied up from one end of the year to the other, thus denying a berth to someone who is anxious to bring in a boat, sail regularly and raise the level of activity around the Club.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome members appear unclear about the<strong> transition to cashless bar</strong> and dining transactions. All members have a membership card that allows them access to the Club premises by opening the door and gate locks and the cards also have a facility to pay for purchases in the Club once credit is added. Credit can be added in a number of ways, including handing the card to one of the barmen with either cash or a credit / debit card and requesting that the card be topped up by whatever amount the member intends to spend in the coming weeks. For those who have signed up to the HYC App on their mobile phone or tablet, credit can be added directly from a bank account to the card and the balance on the membership card, as well as transactions with the Club, can be viewed online. For those who would like advice on how to download and use the HYC App, please contact, or call into, the Club Office and the staff will be happy to assist. Apart from payments, the HYC App allows access to all the information provided on the Club website and it is a valuable addition to the HYC communications offering. In the transition period to becoming cashless, the intention is to continue to facilitate cash purchases and, into the future, cash will be accepted on occasions when there are likely to be temporary members on the premises who will not have a membership card &ndash; e.g. those competing at regattas and the like. Signing in of guests is a requirement of the alcohol licence held for the Club, which is subject to annual renewal by the District Court. A feature of a Club licence is that only members of the Club can purchase alcohol and the last nine Articles of the Club Constitution are specifically included as requirements to hold a licence and regulating the operation of the Club&rsquo;s bar. Article 114 restricts the purchase of alcohol to members of the Club and<strong> Article 115 </strong>sets out the requirement for members to sign in guests they are entertaining on the premises:</p>\n<p>\n\t<em>No visitor shall be supplied with excisable liquor on the Club premises unless on the invitation and in the company of a Member, and that Member, shall, upon the admission of such visitor to the Club premises or immediately upon his being supplied with such liquor, enter his or her own name and the name and address or Club of the visitor in a book which shall show the date of each visit.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the<strong> Visitor&rsquo;s Book </strong>located outside the main door from the stairs landing to the bar, which continues in use, a <strong>tablet-based system</strong> has been introduced for those who are more comfortable using electronic rather than paper-based sign-in. The Bar Staff have been asked to encourage adherence to the above requirements and members&rsquo; co-operation with them is requested. If you are bringing a guest into the Bar, please sign them in - either in the visitors&rsquo; book or using the tablet at the entrance - and be aware that only members can purchase alcohol in the Club. If you (or your guests) are challenged by the staff about whether your guests are signed in, please do not take offence &ndash; the staff are following instructions intended to protect the Club licence as well as the employment of the Club&rsquo;s bar staff. Similarly, if your guest is a non-member and wishes to buy alcohol, please advise them in advance of them placing an order that they cannot purchase alcohol directly.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe winter just being dragged out, still resisting, has been one of the wettest and windiest for many years but hopefully our payback of sunshine and good sailing breezes is just around the corner as we move into April. The Club is waiting for you and I look forward to meeting you here shortly, whether afloat or ashore. Sun cream and shades at the ready - and here&rsquo;s hoping for plenty of use for them!</p>\n<p>\n\t<em><strong>- Neil Murphy, Commodore</strong></em></p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
