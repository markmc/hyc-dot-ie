Race School offers members of all levels an opportunity to learn all the skills you need to participate in club racing and beyond for boat owners and crew. If you have never sailed, already crew on someone else&#39;s boat or even have your own boat, there is an opportunity for all levels to join in training sessions and improve your skills.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">All Race School participants will gain HYC Crew Finder certification which will make it easier to match individual crew to boats looking for Crew.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">With Race School, all levels of sailors get a chance to develop and enhance their racing skills in a safe, professional and supportive environment. Whether you&#39;re a veteran racer or new to the line, we offer programs and courses that are tailored to your skill level and goals.</span></p>\n<div>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">Led by our Sailing Development Officer, Matthew Cotter, our dedicated team includes a combination of skilled instructors, professionals, and volunteers; all of whom share a passion for sailing and racing locally and beyond.</span></div>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>The first step get started is a FREE consultation with Matthew.</strong> </span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">You can chat to him about your experience and what you are looking to achieve. Based on this he can help tailor a programme that will work for you. This initial consultation is just 15 minutes and you can book a face-to-face meeting at the club or if it suits you better you can do this on Zoom.
