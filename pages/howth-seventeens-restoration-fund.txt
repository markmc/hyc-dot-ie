It can be quite a challenge to keep these boats in full racing condition, but their longevity is directly linked to the non-stop racing that the class enjoys from April to November each year.</div>\n<div class="media_embed">\n\tAn easterly storm in the spring of 2018 seriously damaged some of the fleet that had been in their winter storage in the sheds on Howth&#39;s East Pier. Much of the resulting repair work will be carried out by the class, but a huge shortfall means that the Howth Seventeen Footers Association is seeking public donations to help restore those boats that were very badly damaged, in the hope that they can be repaired and launched to go racing within the next 2 years.</div>\n<div class="media_embed">\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div class="media_embed">\n\tIf you would like to help with the restoration, please contact Ian Malcom <a href="mailto:ian.malcolm99@gmail.com">by email here</a> or by phone at: 083 1774099</div>\n<div class="media_embed">\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div class="media_embed">\n\tDonations will be gratefully accepted.</div>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
