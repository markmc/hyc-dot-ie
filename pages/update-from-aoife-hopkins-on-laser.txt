A tricky week dominated by light/medium offshore breeze for the first 5 days and a windy finale on day 6. Everyone had come out of the blocks after months of restrictions and cancelled events, ready to fight. For me, it was the tightest racing I&#39;ve seen since the 2017 Worlds which is amazing considering how different every country&#39;s circumstances and approaches have been since March. Some teams have been training as normal for months while some have barely seen the sea. It was nice to feel some normality during such turbulent&nbsp;times, covid wasn&#39;t on my mind while I was trying to surf waves on the downwind or break an overlap at a mark. It was a solid enough finish of 32nd for me, very promising 45th (and gold fleet qualifier!) for Eve McMahon and 106th for Ewan McMahon in the men&#39;s fleet. We&#39;re currently all in the midst of our two week quarantine and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever studied so much. Those midterms won&#39;t know what&#39;s hit &#39;em ;)</p>\n<p>\n\tAoife Hopkins</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
