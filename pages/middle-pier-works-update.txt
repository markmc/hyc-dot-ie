['\n<p>\n\tThe appointed contractor Sisk will commence preparatory work this week and will likely start construction at the end of October or first week in November.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you haven&rsquo;t seen the plans the scope is to increase the trawler berthing towards the end of the rock armoured inner middle pier light platform and reclaim the area on the opposite outer side enclosed by the elbow with the spoil from dredging the new berths. This is north of the public slip, west of the marina channel and currently occupied by a small number of drying moorings.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe works will take 14 months to end of December 2021. The construction site will require the middle pier to be closed from a point adjacent to the public slipway end. This will displace over 100 parking places for the 14 month period which will be very disruptive for members as existing displaced users will move closer to our clubhouse which will affect all club sailing, &nbsp;open and social events. &nbsp;The expected congestion is significant and the Harbour Master is looking at options to alleviate the pressure and seeking our views and ideas.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe works may include dredging beneath the syncrolift which has very limited range due to silting and pontoon berthing along the West Pier freed by the new trawler berthing. We will keep you posted with developments.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/4079/custom/commodore-signature.jpg?1580326510" style="width: 285px; height: 121px;" /></p>\n']
