Vincent&#39;s stylised 17 Footer carries the number 10 in memory of Mimosa, and ghosts across its polished limestone plinth leaving a just a ripple of bow wave.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause of its weight and fragility, the trophy is now kept in HYC and can be seen in the private &lsquo;Galley&rsquo; dining room.</p>\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">\n\t<a href="/system/files/2979/original/courtney-cup-2016.pdf?1477727430"><span style="color: rgb(105, 105, 105);">2016 Results &gt;&gt;</span></a></h4>\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">\n\t<a href="/system/files/2978/original/courtney-cup-2015.pdf?1477727374"><span style="color: rgb(105, 105, 105);">2015 Results &gt;&gt;</span></a></h4>\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">\n\t<a href="/system/files/2977/original/courtney-cup-2014.pdf?1477727306"><span style="color: rgb(105, 105, 105);">2014 Results &gt;&gt; &nbsp;</span></a></h4>\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">\n\t<a href="/system/files/1946/original/ross-courtney-memorial-trophy-results-2013.pdf?1437494815"><span style="color: rgb(105, 105, 105);">2013 Results &gt;&gt;</span></a></h4>\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">\n\t<a href="/system/files/1945/original/ross-courtney-memorial-trophy-results-2012.pdf?1437494702"><span style="color: rgb(105, 105, 105);">2012 Results &gt;&gt;</span></a></h4>\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">\n\t<a href="/system/files/1944/original/ross-courtney-memorial-trophy-results-2011.pdf?1437494470"><span style="color: rgb(105, 105, 105);">2011 Results &gt;&gt;</span></a></h4>\n<h4 style="text-align: center;">\n\t<a href="/system/files/1943/original/ross-courtney-memorial-trophy-results-2010.pdf?1437494434"><span style="color: rgb(105, 105, 105);"><span style="line-height: 1.4; text-align: left;">2010 Results &gt;&gt;</span></span></a></h4>\n']
