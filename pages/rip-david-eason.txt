He was a very active member of both Howth and Malahide Yacht Clubs and was always happy to volunteer his time and professional knowledge to both. He cut his club administration teeth in Malahide Yacht Club and served as Commodore there before becoming Honorary Treasurer of HYC, subsequently providing long service on the Club&rsquo;s Finance Committee.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe enjoyed a succession of boats, all of them kept in pristine condition. Whilst his own involvement was away from the competitive area of the sport, in the 1980s and 1990s he was well known on the Optimist and Mirror racing circuits, taking great delight in the success of his son, Robert, in both classes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid made a huge contribution to the financial stability of HYC, both as Treasurer and subsequently as a long-term member of the Finance Committee. His well-practiced professional eye and ability to focus on detail were of great assistance in ensuring that the accounts were up to the high standard that he set in all aspects of his life. As the era of electronic presentation of information - including both management and annual accounts - took over from paper records, David remained insistent on seeing the information on paper. Whilst on the Finance Committee, he was hand-delivered a draft copy of the Club&rsquo;s annual accounts in hard copy every year and, based on his scrutiny of them and the incorporation of any amendments he thought appropriate, he was comfortable to propose or second their adoption at the subsequent AGM.</p>\n<p>\n\tDavid is survived by his wife Muriel, his daughter Dorothy and his sons Robert and Derek.</p>\n<p>\n\tDetails of his funeral, from <a href="https://rip.ie/death-notice/david-eason-dublin-swords-536392">rip.ie</a>, can be found below.</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p style="background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-variant-alternates: inherit; font-variant-position: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: Domine; font-optical-sizing: inherit; font-kerning: inherit; font-feature-settings: inherit; font-variation-settings: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(61, 50, 14); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">\n\t<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="color:#000000;">EASON, David (Robert Sidney) (Swords) - November 16th, 2023, (peacefully) at the Mater Private Hospital.
