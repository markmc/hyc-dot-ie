With sailors and supporters coming from all over Ireland and abroad to participate in mainstay events like Autumn League, ICRA Nationals, and the J24 National Championships, corporate sponsorships offer brands an opportunity to see and be seen by a vast audience with a vested interest in the sport of sailing.&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>\n\tOpportunities in HYC</h1>\n<p>\n\tWith the busy sailing season imminently upon us, the team has been very busy organising and scheduling Club Racing and Open Events. With each season&rsquo;s calendar becoming more and more busy, and a number of events competing for entries, the costs of entering a large number of regattas can add up quickly over the season.&nbsp; The team here in HYC is focused on ensuring we keep the entry fees as low as possible whilst doing our best to offer our renowned, world-class events.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we strive to keep costs low, the unfortunate reality is that the background costs are an ever-increasing pressure on the event budgets, which is where the role of an event sponsor is critical to ensure the event can be operated at a cost that is not prohibitive to the sailors.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have a small number of very supportive and valued organisations that support events each year, but in reality, it is not fair to be seeking the same support year in and year out.&nbsp; As such we are hoping to forge some new relationships with companies and brands that we can help create exposure and marketing opportunities.</p>\n<div>\n\tWe would like to offer the opportunity to existing members before we widen the net.&nbsp; It struck us that there are a number of members in the club whose companies are looking for event sponsorship opportunities and this could be a real win-win for you and HYC.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe opportunity is twofold - Firstly it gives your company access to a highly desirable ABC1 audience and secondly helps provide much-needed support to sailors.</div>\n<p>\n\tSponsorship partnerships with HYC are multi-faceted and can be readily tailored to meet the marketing and brand awareness needs of each sponsor. We have a number of options for sponsors, from having their brand displayed on any number of the signage areas and flags throughout the Club, use of facilities for corporate entertainment, social media exposure, event naming and branding of supporting documents, digital and national media coverage, direct brand awareness amongst the competitors and wider membership, and also the gratitude of the competitors and members. The sponsorship brings cache to an event, a good sense of pageantry with the brand colours on display, and allows for the event to be run to a high standard and also at a cost-effective level. Sponsorship often comes in the form of financial support, but can also be provided through&nbsp;tangible products or a mix of both.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you are interested in learning more about how event sponsorship works at HYC or you think your company would be interested in supporting an open event and sailing in Howth, please do get in touch.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere is a flavour of some of the events your company could get involved in:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tDinghy Regatta</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tFingal Series</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tLambay Races</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tVarious class championships</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tNational Championships (Puppeteers / Howth 17s)</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tAutumn League</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tBrass Monkey Series</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tWinter Frostbite Series</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tNew Years Day races</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tClub racing</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tSpeciality events such as Wave / Selected Eastern Championships or&nbsp; Nationals for a variety of classes</div>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\tIf you are interested in discussing any of these opportunities please reach out directly to <a href="mailto:gary@providentcrm.com?subject=HYC%20Event%20Sponsorship%20">Gary Cullen</a>, Rear Commodore, HYC.</p>\n']
