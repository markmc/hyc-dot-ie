Which of the following will I require:</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sea Going Boat.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; River Boat.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canal Boat.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day or Weekend Cruising Boat.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long distance Cruising Boat.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Live aboard Boat.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">What size do you require, i.e.&nbsp; Length overall , Beam, draft. You must enquire from whichever Marina you intend to use whether they can cope with the dimensions that you are considering.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">Next, You should consider what Size of Engine or Engines you will need. If you are buying a second hand boat check that she has a service history for the engines and whether it has been maintained by the agent for that make of engine.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">Amount of Accommodation below decks ? Does she have adequate seating area to entertain you and your friends / crew. Also the number of bunks below, how many will you need ? The Galley area is most important. Is the size of the galley adequate for you to cook and produce fine cuisine ! Is it equipped with a good cooker/oven, does it have a large enough freezer box and fridge. Is there a microwave and kettle etc?</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">Navigation Equipment ; Is she adequately kitted out with modern navigation gear to make the life of the Skipper / Navigator easier.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">Does the Boat have a good windless to let down and take up the heavy anchor and chain. Learn about anchoring ,it is a whole subject on its own.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">Running Costs;&nbsp; The average running costs is approximately 20% of the value of your boat per annum. However this may change as the costs of fuel varies from time to time.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">Consider your level of Boating / Yachting experience. If you are inexperienced doing a Motor Boat course is vital , Single prop, Twin Props is also a consideration.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">Finance. Again this is a complete subject to itself. Do you fund the purchase or get Marine Finance. Remember that most yachts Depreciate over time and what you are paying finance for might not be the true value of what you own.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">Before you make a purchase, talk to other motor boat owners. Checkout Forums re the boat you are considering. Make sure you use an Experienced Yacht/Motor Boat Surveyor to do a comprehensive survey . Ask for their opinion as they are experienced in this area.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size: 16px;">Finally, Remember, this is just your Hobby or Sport.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">Best of luck with your purchase.</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style="font-size:16px;">Howard.</span></p>\n']
