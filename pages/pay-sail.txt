No boat is no excuse, we have our Come Sailing Team ready to take you out on Wednesday nights, Saturday afternoons and on other days by arrangement. This is the best way to get to know other racing boats and enjoy the socialising after. We provide the skipper and you can choose from a Wednesday evening or Saturday afternoon. You can invite a friend if you like.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tSimply email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:comesailing@hyc.ie?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20Come%20Sailing%20in%20HYC">Comesailing@hyc.ie</a>. We will call you&nbsp; back and confirm the arrangements. Costs are &euro;30 per person for the evening and it includes the use of sailing gear and buoyancy aids if you require them. We look forward to getting you hooked.
