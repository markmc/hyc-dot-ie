Our objective is to get more motor boat and RIB owners using their boats over an expanded area in a safe and enjoyable way. There is comfort and security travelling as a group, particularly when venturing further than the local area. Ideally this group is suitable for boats that can motor along at a steady 12-14 knots.</p>\n<div>\n\tThe excursions we plan will be based on the minimal shelter/ facilities on board with the focus on specific destination shore breaks. Initial destinations being considered are Skerries, Dun Laoghaire, Greystones, Liffey to Jeanie Johnston etc. All trips will include a stop for coffee and a bun or something more substantial depending on where and when followed by heading home on a varied route where possible.&nbsp;</div>\n<p>\n\tIf you&rsquo;re interested in joining please contact <a href="mailto:alanpkinsella@gmail.com?subject=Motor%20Boating%20Group">Alan Kinsella&nbsp;</a>for more information on how to sign up.</p>\n']
