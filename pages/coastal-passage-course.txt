Topics such as weather, tide, navigation, buoyage, shipping and communications will be covered. There will also be information on sailing at night.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe cost is to be confirmed but, as usual, will include a substantial discount for member. The price will include a practice chart.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is envisaged that an actual trip would take place within the following two weeks, putting the theory into practice.
