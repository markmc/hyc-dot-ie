['\n<div>\n\t<em>March 27th 2020</em></div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t<strong>Announcement re Fireball Worlds in Howth 2020</strong><img alt="" src="/system/files/4167/custom/fireball.png?1585339090" style="width: 280px; height: 280px; float: right; margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;" /></div>\n<div>\n\tIn response to the global Coronavirus outbreak the Irish Fireball &nbsp;Association Howth Yacht Club and Fireball International have been evaluating the plans for the Fireball Worlds in Howth in August.</div>\n<div>\n\tWe recognise the severity of the current crisis. Whilst there are challenges and uncertainty, at this time we are proceeding under the assumption that our World Championships may go ahead successfully.</div>\n<div>\n\tWe will continue to monitor the situation closely and expect to be able to make a more definitive statement in the next few weeks. You may anticipate a further announcement around the 24th April. At that time, if the decision is made to cancel or postpone the event, HYC will fully refund all entry fees to those who have entered. In the meantime competitors are advised not to incur any non refundable expenses (travel, accommodation, etc.).</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThis is a very difficult time and the priority right now is to do what is necessary to ensure the health and safety of our families, friends and communities. We appreciate everyone&rsquo;s patience and continued support.</div>\n<div>\n\t<p>\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<hr />\n\t<p>\n\t\t&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n\t<em>February 26th 2020</em></div>\n<div>\n\t<div class="media_embed">\n\t\t<div class="media_embed">\n\t\t\t<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slycHy2pit8" width="560"></iframe></div>\n\t</div>\n\t<br />\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tHere&rsquo;s a quick update of news for #Howth2020 &ndash; You&rsquo;ll hopefully have spotted that discounts are now in place thanks to Irish Ferries for travel from the UK and continental Europe. Details of how to book with discount can be found under Irish Ferries Deal on this website. And camper van and camping spaces are secured at Suttonians Rugby Football Club just one light rail stop from the club. Facilities include loos and showers and fees will be 30 euros per night for camper vans and 20 euros per night for tents. Many other forms of accommodation are still available but our strong advice is to book early. We expect up to four entire houses will be available to rent for the event thanks to HYC members &ndash; expressions of interest should be sent to events@hyc.ie.</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tEquipment measurement for the event will be supervised by International Measurer Fergus O&rsquo;Kelly who recently ran an equipment measurement course on behalf of Irish Sailing &ndash; participants included many of our Irish Fireball Association volunteers who will be helping make the process as smooth and fast as possible for our Worlds.</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tWe hope to announce a significant sponsor soon but meanwhile we&rsquo;re delighted to say that Fingal County Council have approved a grant to help us fund the event. So we&rsquo;re beavering away here in Howth with regular planning meetings. We&rsquo;d love you to support us by following through and entering the event now via the online process on this website. As well as helping us you might win a bottle of the finest Irish whiskey which is being raffled amongst the first 10 boats to enter! We look forward to welcoming you to Howth!</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\tNOR now published and live entry is open ... <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a href="https://www.hyc.ie/open-events?year=2020#event-324">Click here</a></span></div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<img alt="" src="/system/files/4024/custom/fireball-news.jpg?1578441020" style="width: 150px; height: 234px; float: left; margin: 5px;" />\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div class="media_embed">\n\t\t\t\t<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="225" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGWk4e9kf-Y" width="400"></iframe></div>\n\t\t\t<div class="media_embed">\n\t\t\t\t<em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Fireball World Championships in Fenit 1970)</em></div>\n\t\t\t<div class="media_embed">\n\t\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t\t<div class="media_embed">\n\t\t\t\t&nbsp;</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n']
